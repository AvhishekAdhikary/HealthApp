# HealthAppTry1
Created with CodeSandbox

========================

This is a health applicaiton that detects the chances of having diabetes in a patient.

This app is completely developed from scratch by me and requires React.js packages to run the application.

To deploy this project into a webserver you will also need Node.js and Express.js packages.

========================

I have tried to make this UI as simple as possible so that the inputs are user friendly and are commonly known by the user.
This application is still not complete as it requires the algorithm.
This algorithm was provided by a colleague of mine.

========================

I hope you like this application.
